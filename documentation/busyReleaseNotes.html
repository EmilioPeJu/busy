  <h1>
    busy Release Notes</h1>
  <h2>
    Release 1-7</h2>
  <p>
    Fix to asyn device support. There were 2 problems:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Problem 1
      <ul>
        <li>Busy record has a value of 1 autosave file. (It is not sufficient to have 1 in
          the .db file, because device support reads the value from the driver, and that will
          be 0.</li>
        <li>Driver does an initial callback with value 0 as soon as iocInit completes, i.e.
          when interruptAccept=1.</li>
        <li>Driver gets sent the value 1, but the record has the value 0.</li>
        <li>This happens because the callback with value 0 occurs after the driver has queued
          the request to send 1 but before the value is written to the driver. The 0 to 1
          callback which happens later is ignorred by device support.</li>
        <li>This occurs in devBusyAsyn.c R1-6-1 and earlier.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Problem 2
      <ul>
        <li>Driver is configured for asynchronous device support (ASYN_CANBLOCK=1)</li>
        <li>Busy record sends a value of 1 to driver.</li>
        <li>Driver immediately does a callback with a value of 0.</li>
        <li>Busy record is stuck in the 1 state, it ignores the callback value of 0 because
          PACT=1 when callback occurs.</li>
        <li>This problem was introduced in devBusyAsyn.c commit a04e121da0acd71226fbe722fbf1b9551b21fe00
          which was an attempt to fix problem 1 above. There was no released version of the
          busy module with this bug.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A test application to demonstrate these problems can be found in the quadEM module
    in the testAsynBusyApp directory. The test application could not be put in the busy
    module because the problem depends on autosave, and busy does not depend on autosave.</p>
  <p>
    This release changes the interrupt callback logic. Previously it was directly calling
    monitor() and recGblFwdLink. It was hard to get the logic right, and the 2 previous
    versions of this support had bugs discussed above. This version just processes the
    record via scanOnce on every callback. Note that this callback logic is not as sophisticated
    as the standard asyn device support. That support handles callback bursts via a
    ring buffer, and sets the record status and severity based on the status passed
    to the callback. In the future we might want to change to using the standard devAsynInt32
    device support, but that requires making the busy module an optional dependency
    of asyn.</p>
  <p>
    This fix has the further advantage of making the record have correct timestamps
    when callbacks occur, which was not the case with the previous versions.</p>
  <h2>
    Release 1-6-1</h2>
  <p>
    Build failed on Windows because comment character not at beginning of line.</p>
  <h2>
    Release 1-6</h2>
  <p>
    Fixed a bug when the using asynchronous device support, for example devBusyAsyn
    with an asyn port driver with ASYN_CANBLOCK. The problem occurred when 0 was written
    to the record, followed immediately by writing 1. If the record was still processing
    with the 0 value when the 1 was written, device support would not process a second
    time with the 1 value. It should have processed a second time with the 1 value (via
    the EPICS .RPRO field), but this was not happening.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Release 1-5</h2>
  <p>
    configure/CONFIG no longer defines STATIC_BUILD=YES on any platform.</p>
  <p>
    Added caQtDM display.</p>
  <h2>
    Release 1-4</h2>
  <p>
    Added autosave-request file busyRecord_settings.req.</p>
  <p>
    RELEASE* changes</p>
  <p>
    Added .opi display file for CSS-BOY</p>
  <h2>
    Release 1-3</h2>
  <p>
    Added busyRecord.db database, xxBusyRecord.adl medm-display file.</p>
  <p>
    busyRecord.c rewritten to minimize differences from 3.14.11 bo record.</p>
  <h2>
    Release 1-2</h2>
  <p>
    Ben Franksen's "Raw Soft Channel" device support allows the busy record to write
    a user configurable integer value (the value of the MASK field) via its OUT link,
    when the record's VAL field has the value 1. Currently, MASK can only be specified
    at DCT time. For example, you can configure MASK to a bit-pattern and have the BUSY
    record write this value to a selRecord's SELN field.</p>
  <h2>
    Release 1-1</h2>
  <p>
    The busy record was reimplemented to permit device support to reset the VAL field
    to zero.</p>
  <p>
    This version is intended to build with EPICS base 3.14.10.</p>
  <h2>
    Release 1-0</h2>
  <p>
    This is the first release of the synApps busy module.</p>
  <p>
    This version is intended to build with EPICS base 3.14.10.</p>
